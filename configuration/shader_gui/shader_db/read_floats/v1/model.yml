    data: "description:\n  markdown: \"# brief\\n\\nThis shader interprets the texture data as one-dimensional array where every pixel represents two 16bit values between 0 and 1. These two values are returned. Input parameters are the texture, the index, the image resolution (x and y), a skip value defining how much pixels to skip per index, and an offset value added to the index to identify the pixel of interest. The pixel x and y position are calculated by:\\n\\n    x = mod(index*skip+offset, resolution.x)\\n    y = (index+skip+offset)/resolution.x\"\n"
